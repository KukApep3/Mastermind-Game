      <p> A game called 'Moo' was used on the Cambridge Titan shared computer system
	     to help develop security applications by tempting hackers to modify the
	    'Moo League' of scores as a harmless diversion. The game involved guessing four
	    numbers, scoring 'Bulls' or 'Cows' for correct numbers in the right or wrong places.
	    Dr John Billingsley perceived that the game could be Homeed equally
	    effectively by his children with pencil and paper. Some time before 1976 he
	    was engaged in a consultancy with Invicta Plastics, whose products at the
	    time featured plastic inserts for footwear. He was asked if he could think
	    of a game that could use their technology and the game of Moo sprang to mind.
	    At the time, the TV quiz show Mastermind was in vogue and he suggested that
	    name, never believing that it would be permitted. He influenced the design
	    of the board, insisting that the 'results' pegs should be arranged in a
	    square rather than in a line, to avoid each result being associated with a
	    particular guess peg. Thinking that the game was 'public domain' or that
	    the rights belonged elsewhere, he was unwilling to make any claim for it.</p>

	    <p class="clear">Since 1971, the rights to Mastermind have been held by Invicta Plastics of Oadby,
	    near Leicester, UK. (Invicta always named the game Master Mind.)
	    They originally manufactured it themselves, though they have since licensed its
	    manufacture to Hasbro worldwide, with the exception of Pressman Toys and Orda Industries
	    who have the manufacturing rights to the United States and Israel,respectively.

	    <p class="clear">Starting in 1973, the game box featured a photograph of a well-dressed,
	    distinguished-looking man seated in the foreground, with a woman standing
	    behind him. The two amateur models (Bill Woodward and Cecilia Fung) reunited
	    in June 2003 to pose for another publicity photo.</p>
