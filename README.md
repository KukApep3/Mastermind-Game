# Mastermind-Game
This is a school project of the Mastermind board game.

This is a project made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I made this with another colleague. He is the expert with JavaScript, and i worked with the HTML and CSS.

This is not a perfect game project, it has some flaws and i wanna ask for someone to email me if you find any error. My email is kukapep3@gmail.com.

THE GAME

To star, open the 'index.html' file. From there you can navigate to wherever you like.
You can create an account. To play you'll have to have one, but if you don't, you'll play as a guess.

We used the LocalStorage of the browser to create the accounts instead of cookies, and because of that it may not work perfectly at every browser. 

Anyway, hope you enjoy it.
